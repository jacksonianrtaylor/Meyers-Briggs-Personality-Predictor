#LOOK: How do you achieve a final model from all the testing???
#for each pair take the best tested (model type and nof features).
#train the (model type and nof features) again (just once without cross validation)
#test the model for a single user (input vector of tf-idf for terms the users used)
#repeat for all personality pairs
